# Intro
Everybody has made a resolution at some point in life. Be it New Year's or not - resolution is a resolution. Sadly, everybody as well failed to keep one. But fear not, there are some things which may help with keeping said resolutions. One of them is keeping a sort of 'visual register', where one can mark whether the resolution has been met in a certain period of time. For example - mark your calendar with a happy face when if went to the gym today!
This helps with overall motivation on keeping the goal.

## What does it all have to do with this project?
Well, marking marks in calendar is nice, but nowadays more and more people use electronic calendars (for example Google Calendar). In them, a feature allowing you to make a mark on a day is rarely seen (at least that's what my not-so-thorough research shows).
Another thing that most people use are computers. Computers in turns, use desktops and wallpapers (well, mostly).

Whole idea behind this project is simple - make an app that allows you to mark each day. Idea is simple, but possibilities are broad. From personalizing the mark, through making various for different periods of time, all the way to automatically setting a wallpaper with a marked calendar for current month.

This being said, automation of making and setting a wallpaper seems like a distant goal.

# Main purpose
This project is meant mainly as a way of learning Ruby (and perhaps Ruby on Rails) while working with it.
